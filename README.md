## üìù <span id="description">Description</span>

This repository serves as the foundational component for a comprehensive project aimed at creating an Airbnb clone.
<br>
It marks the initial phase of this student undertaking, introducing a powerful backend interface, often referred to as a console.
<br>
The console empowers users with the ability to effortlessly manage various program data, including object creation, updates, deletions, and efficient file storage management.
<br>
By leveraging JSON serialization and deserialization, data persistence is seamlessly maintained across multiple sessions, setting the stage for subsequent projects like HTML/CSS templating, database integration, API development, and front-end integration.
